# Security Improvements Documentation

## File: `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`

### Summary

This file was refactored to address several security vulnerabilities in the authentication and authorization logic. The following improvements were made:

---

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Added validation for email, password, and name fields.**
- **Sanitized user input** before passing to Supabase authentication methods.
- Prevents attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and logic errors due to malformed input.

---

### 2. Password Strength Enforcement

- **Enforced strong password requirements** (minimum length, character types).
- Prevents weak passwords that could compromise user accounts.

---

### 3. Error Handling & Information Disclosure

- **Returned generic error messages** to the client instead of exposing internal Supabase error details.
- Prevents attackers from enumerating valid/invalid accounts or learning about internal logic.

---

### 4. User Data Exposure

- **Limited user/session data returned** to only safe fields (e.g., user id, email, name).
- Prevents leaking sensitive information such as tokens or internal IDs.

---

### 5. Session Management

- **Logout function improved** to return generic errors and note cookie/session invalidation (if applicable).

---

### 6. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection (Recommendation)

- Rate limiting is recommended at the API or middleware level, but not implemented directly in this file.

---

## Example Changes

```typescript
// Input validation
if (!isValidEmail(data.email)) {
  return { error: 'Invalid email address.' };
}
if (!isStrongPassword(data.password)) {
  return { error: 'Password does not meet security requirements.' };
}
if (!isValidName(data.name)) {
  return { error: 'Invalid name.' };
}

// Generic error messages
if (error) {
  return { error: 'Authentication failed.' };
}

// Limit user/session data exposure
const { id, email, user_metadata } = data.user;
return { id, email, name: user_metadata?.name };
```

## Next Steps

Continue reviewing and documenting security improvements for other authentication and authorization files.
