# Security Improvements Documentation

## File: `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`

### Summary

This file was refactored to address several security vulnerabilities in the authentication and authorization logic. The following improvements were made:

---

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Added validation for email, password, and name fields.**
- **Sanitized user input** before passing to Supabase authentication methods.
- Prevents attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and logic errors due to malformed input.

---

### 2. Password Strength Enforcement

- **Enforced strong password requirements** (minimum length, character types).
- Prevents weak passwords that could compromise user accounts.

---

### 3. Error Handling & Information Disclosure

- **Returned generic error messages** to the client instead of exposing internal Supabase error details.
- Prevents attackers from enumerating valid/invalid accounts or learning about internal logic.

---

### 4. User Data Exposure

- **Limited user/session data returned** to only safe fields (e.g., user id, email, name).
- Prevents leaking sensitive information such as tokens or internal IDs.

---

### 5. Session Management

- **Logout function improved** to return generic errors and note cookie/session invalidation (if applicable).

---

### 6. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection (Recommendation)

- Rate limiting is recommended at the API or middleware level, but not implemented directly in this file.

---

## Example Changes

```typescript
// Input validation
if (!isValidEmail(data.email)) {
  return { error: 'Invalid email address.' };
}
if (!isStrongPassword(data.password)) {
  return { error: 'Password does not meet security requirements.' };
}
if (!isValidName(data.name)) {
  return { error: 'Invalid name.' };
}

// Generic error messages
if (error) {
  return { error: 'Authentication failed.' };
}

// Limit user/session data exposure
const { id, email, user_metadata } = data.user;
return { id, email, name: user_metadata?.name };
```

## File: `app/lib/context/auth-context.tsx`

### Summary

This file was refactored to address several security vulnerabilities in the authentication context logic. The following improvements were made:

---

### 1. Sensitive Data Exposure

- **Limited exposed user/session fields in context** to only safe fields (`id`, `email`, `name`, `access_token`).
- Prevents leaking sensitive information such as tokens, internal IDs, or metadata to all components.

---

### 2. Error Handling

- **Improved error handling:** errors are tracked in state and not logged to the console.
- Enables UI components to display generic error messages and avoids leaking sensitive error details in production.

---

### 3. Session Management

- **State is cleared on sign out,** reducing risk of stale or leaked data.
- If cookies are used for authentication, they should be cleared here as well.

---

### 4. Logging

- **Removed sensitive logging of user objects** from the context provider.
- Prevents accidental exposure of user data in production logs.

---

### 5. Context API Improvements

- **Added an `error` field to context** for UI error handling.
- Ensures all context consumers can handle authentication errors gracefully.

---

## Example Changes

```tsx
// Only expose safe user/session fields
const [user, setUser] = useState<SafeUser>(null);
const [session, setSession] = useState<SafeSession>(null);

// Error handling
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
if (error) {
  // Show generic error in UI
}

// Clear state on sign out
const signOut = async () => {
  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  setUser(null);
  setSession(null);
};
```

---

## Next Steps

Continue reviewing and documenting security improvements for other authentication and authorization files.
